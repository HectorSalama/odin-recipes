        <img src="../images/chilaquiles.jpg">
        <p>Chilaquiles, a Mexican dish consisting of 
            strips or pieces of corn tortillas that are 
            fried, then sautéed with green or red salsa, 
            and topped with cheese, crema (a sweet, 
            thin cream sauce), and onion. Pulled chicken 
            may also be added during the cooking process, 
            and casserole versions of the dish are popular.</p>
        
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

            <li>8 fresh tomatillos, husks removed </li>
            <li>1 white onion, coarsely chopped</li>
            <li>1 poblano pepper, peeled and seeded</li>
            <li>1 jalapeno pepper, seeded</li>
            <li>¾ cup chopped cilantro</li>
            <li>4 cloves garlic</li>
            <li>2 leaves fresh mint</li>
            <li>salt to taste</li>
            <li>3 cups shredded cooked chicken</li>
            <li>¼ cup vegetable oil</li>
            <li>12 (6 inch) white corn tortillas, cut into 3 strips</li>
            <li>¾ cup shredded pepperjack cheese</li>
            <li>¾ cup shredded Monterey Jack cheese</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Blend tomatillos, onion, poblano pepper, jalapeno 
                pepper, cilantro, garlic, mint, and salt in a blender 
                until smooth. Transfer mixture to a saucepan and 
                bring to a gentle boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and 
                simmer until thickened, stirring often, about 10 minutes. 
                Add chicken to tomatillo sauce and continue to simmer 
                until chicken is heated through, about 5 minutes more.</li>
            <li>Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium heat. 
                Fry tortilla strips in batches until crisp and lightly 
                browned, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain on a paper towel-lined plate.</li>
            <li>Layer about half the fried tortillas in a 2-quart baking 
                dish; spread half the tomatillo sauce over tortillas. 
                Mix pepperjack cheese and Monterey Jack cheese in a bowl; 
                sprinkle half over tomatillo sauce. Repeat layers.</li>
            <li>Bake in preheated oven until cheese is golden and bubbly, 
                30 to 35 minutes. Allow to cool 5 minutes before serving.</li>
        </ol>
